    <p> 
        I'm Georgia, a grade 12 student who got into programming after taking computer science in grade 10. With my newfound passion, I began to explore ways to apply my programming knowledge, primarily through personal projects. The purpose of this website is to showcase my projects as well as some information about me.
    </p> 

    <p> 
        As well as programming, I am also interested in music, volleyball, badminton, tennis, math and occasionally, art and design (and sometimes, I phase in and out of my competitive Minesweeper phase （／．＼）) 
    </p> 

    <p>
        Well before my programming passion started however, I was amazed by storytelling after watching a youtube playthrough of UNDERTALE. The emotional aspect of the game conveyed to me the power that games can have on people and I wanted to create something that impacted people as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the future, I aim to participate in more hackathons/game jams to gain coding and collaborative experience and continue pursuing my personal projects.
